# Election_Analysis
The purpose of this election audit analysis was to help Colorado's election process and using python to ensure the votes were counted correctly.

## Overview of Project
A Colorado Board of Elections employee gave me the task of completing an election audit of a recent local congressional election. It was my job to use tools such as Python and Visual Studio Code to create code and provide us with the results.
