##Election Audit Summary
Since this script takes from an excel file, the only thing you would have to do to modify it is change the pathing to a different excel file. The point of this script was to take information from the file and put it into a visual format so we could read it. While one modification would be chosing a different text file with similar formatting, the other would be to change in which columns the text reads candidate and county names if a file had similar but slightly different formatting.
